* Changes
** 0.2.1
Chime correctly handles empty time seqs - thanks to Alex ter Weele ([[https://github.com/aterweele][aterweele]])
for the report.

** 0.2.0

Breaking change/functionality clarification: previously, if a job was scheduled
before the timer was cancelled, the job would still run. After 0.2.0, jobs that
haven't started before the timer is cancelled will not run.

Thanks to Dave Harlan ([[https://github.com/dkharlan][dkharlen]]) for raising the issue!

** 0.1.8 / 0.1.9

(work around in http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/ASYNC-32). Thanks

Deps bump to Clojure 1.7, core.async 0.2.374, and clj-time 0.11 -

Deploying 0.1.9 because Clojars part-failed on 0.1.8
